### Investigating the Impact of Modified Tor Traffic on Onion Service Traffic Classification



This project explores how traditional and advanced machine learning algorithms can classify anonymized Tor traffic as either **regular Tor services** or **Onion services**, even after data modification techniques like padding.



---



### 📌 Objective



To evaluate the effectiveness of multiple machine learning models (SVM, KNN, Random Forest, and AdaBoost) in detecting Onion services over Tor by analyzing traffic patterns—even when those patterns are modified to evade detection (e.g., WTF-PAD).

### 🧠 Algorithms Used



* ✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM)

* ✅ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

* ✅ Random Forest

* ✅ AdaBoost (Extension - Achieved 100% accuracy)



---



### 📊 Datasets



* **No Defence Tor Traffic** – Original unmodified Tor traffic

* **OS Dataset** – Traffic from Onion services

* **WTFPAD** – Tor traffic modified using Website Fingerprinting defenses

* ✅ Merged and preprocessed for feature selection and accuracy comparison



> 📦 Datasets are in `.pkl` format and sourced from:

### 📂 File Structure (Important Note)



Due to GitHub file size limits, large `.pkl` files (like `X_train_NoDef.pkl` or `WTFPAD.pkl`) are **not included** in this repository. You can:



* Download them manually from the above sources

* Or use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com) to manage them if needed
